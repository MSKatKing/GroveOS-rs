# GroveOS

Welcome to the repository of GroveOS!

### What is GroveOS?

GroveOS is a Rust-based operating system built from scratch mostly as a hobby. This codebase is accompanied by a collection of blog-style pages explaining a lot of what the code does. If anyone is looking at building their own operating system, I hope that those pages prove to be helpful. The pages can be found at
